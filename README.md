## Introduction


This website was constructed as the e-commerce hub and digital marketing platform for a start-up business - plantsupports.ie. The pandemic
has created a new generation of horticulture and gardening enthusiasts, and indeed rekindled a few old flames, who have found that growing 
is good for the soul, promotes emotional and mental wellbeing, reduces stress, boosts mood and  provides a sense of fulfilment. Plant  
supports are a contemporary and effective method of gardening which have a number of key benefits that make them popular with gardeners of 
all levels of expereience.


### Benefits include: 

-	As the name suggests, providing support and structure, which can help prevent plants from breaking or falling over due to windy conditions 
    or heavy, overloaded branches. Broken or damaged stems are pathways for pests and disease. 

-	Correct support also helps keep fruits off the ground, where they can become damaged, rot or fall victim to insects.  

-	Upright plants are easier to maintain and don’t have issues with soil splash from watering or heavy rains, where soil-borne fungus can take 
    hold. Harvesting is also made easier too.  

-	Finally, plants having adequate support throughout the growing season are stronger and healthier overall since they’re not blowing all over 
    the place, which weakens them over time. 

In Ireland, many garden centres and retailers are closed, and the future is incredibly uncertain. Most retailers and suppliers have made efforts 
to increase their online presence and promote e-commerce. With this project, we set out to establish an online presence for our start-up business, 
address the relatively slow uptake of e-commerce solutions by retailers in the horticultural sector in Ireland, provide optimal user experience 
and produce a real-life demonstration of my development expertise for my user centric frontend development milestone project. It’s designed to 
be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers.

- These were the initial wireframes created during the project inception phase. As the project and my skills evolved, so too did the design of the site, hence, the wireframes do not exactly mirror the 
  final project.

## Design


### Typography

- The Roboto font was the chosen font for the body of this site with Sans Serif as the safe alternative in the case of Roboto not being imported 

- Roboto is a widespread and visually-pleasing font style. Roboto is a neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface family developed by Google as the system font 
  for its mobile operating system Android. I have seen it utilised effectively on a number of similar websites during my research and selected it for this project.

### Imagery 

- The imagery selected is a key feature for attracting prospective buyers. The large hero-image on the Home Page is designed to be striking, to catch the user's attention and
to show an example of the product being put to effective use. There is an image of the father and son team in the About Us page to help personalize the business story. There is
also an image gallery with six eye-catching photos of the product range, designed to be visually-appealing and entice the viewer into a purchase. 

### Colour Schemes

- The website generally has bright and vibrant colours,  which is in keeping with the product and it's purpose - to improve a garden. A light grey theme was utilised for the navbar and
footer. This helps the call-to-action button in the navbar, along with the logo, standout as much as possible. There is a recurring theme of green throughout the website, again, in line
with the subject matter. The shade of green was selected in the planning and research stage of the project and is rgb(114, 214, 84). A bright tone is present on most pages, creating an 
aesthetic and relatively simple design which aids to the intuitiveness of the site as a whole.

## Features 

### Common Features To All Pages 

- Responsive on all device sizes

- Interactive elements 

- The website is divided into five separate pages - a home page, an about us page, a gallery, an order page and contact page.

- Header 

  - Each page has the same header, with company logo located on the left and a navigation menu with a 'Request Callback' CTA button located on the right within the same row. 
  - The company logo is clickable and will link back to the site homepage 
  - The header is fixed at the top of the screen and will scroll with the page contents, allowing users to easily navigate through the website no matter where they are on the page, hence creating an intuitive design. 
  - The navigations links undergo a colour change when a user's cursor hovers over it. This feature is available only a desktop or laptop but indicates to the site user that the 
    navigation link is clickable.
  - On a mobile device the navigation links will collapse into a dropdown button, with the navigation links displaying on the top left of the screen. 
  - The header could be further enhanced in the future by adding functionality to the 'Request Callback' button for site users to book a telephone consultation or seek expert advice

- Footer 

  - Each page has the same footer which is located at the bottom page and does not scroll with the page contents in order to save screen real estate. 
  - A copyright disclaimer is located on the left of the footer which states the year of creation and content creator.
  - To the middle of the footer, is a download brochure option, which will undergo a colour change when the user's cursor hovers over it. 
  - The company social media links are positioned to the right of the footer and each site is represented by it's relative icon. They will also undergo a colour change when 
    a user's cursor hovers over it, again, showing it's a clickable link.

## Testing 

### HTML Validation 

-The HTML was validated online using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The site's five pages were separtely validated using this online tool to ensure that there were no 
syntax or structural errors within the code. The results of this testing are indicated below in the relevant sections.

  -Home Page [(W3C Validation Report)](./assets/images/indexw3c.png) 

   The first testing of the homepage using the validation tool came back with no errors or warnings to report.

  -About Us Page [(W3C Validation Report)](./assets/images/aboutw3c.png) 

   The HTML validation tool reported two errors within the code of the about us page, which were two stray end div tags. The two relevant tags were subsequently removed from the code.

  -Gallery Page [(W3C Validation Report)](./assets/images/galleryw3c.png) 

   The HTML Validation tool highlighted a warning that the section element, which the site gallery is incorporated into, lacks a heading. Right from the project inception and initial design, I had 
   never intended to include a heading for my gallery page. The site is user-friendly, intuitive and has a clear navigation menu that is fixed to whatever page the user is viewing and is relatively basic
   in design. The user would know what page of the site they are currently viewing (active page) through the particular page link in the nav bar being black in colour as dintinct from the non-active options 
   which are grey. Adding a gallery heading could be implemented in the future as the site evolves to identify the section for screen readers, even though it is not currently neccessary for the visual design.
   
  -Order Page [(W3C Validation Report Part 1)](./assets/images/orderw3c1.png) [(W3C Validation Report Part 2)](./assets/images/orderw3c2.png) 

   The HTML validation tool reported six errors within the code of the order page. The relevant br elements were subsequently removed and the code restructured to correct errors 2 and 3 in the above reports.

  -Contact Page [(W3C Validation Report)](./assets/images/contactw3c.png) 

   The first testing of the contact page using the validation tool came back with no errors or warnings to report.


### CSS Validation 

-The CSS was validated online using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The site was validated using this online tool to ensure that there were no 
syntax or structural errors within the code and was entered into the validator tool by direct input.

![CSS Validator Report](./assets/images/cssvalidator.png) 

### Performance Testing 

- The site was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari Web Browsers, and was fully functioning and responsive. 

- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, tablet, iPhone 7 & iPhone X. All formats were correctly structured and displayed well. 

- I completed a vast array of detailed and comprehensive testing of my site to ensure that all links functioned correctly. This composed of 
  navigating through each page of my site and clicking every link/button that is available to a user (as part of their UX journey) to ensure that everything was fucntioning correctly. I examined the
  user stories indicated in the UX section of this document to ensure my site achieved each of these objectives.

- I requested the my project be peer viewed twice on Slack by my fellow students. I received several positive reviews and important recommendations which I implemented into my project on both occasions.
  A number of my fellow students tested my site in it's entirety and confirmed the site functioned correctly and as expected. 

- [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) was used to confirm responsiveness on different device resolutions. 

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was also utilised as a high fidelity responsive design tool for previewing and testing site across a variety of popular devices.

- Lighthouse used within Chrome Dev tools to assess performance on desktop & mobile display, final results below: 


#### Desktop:

### Known Bugs & Issues

- The Upcoming Pop-up Shops section was originally structured using a table format. Unfortunately, tables don't typically render too well on a mobile so using the relevant bootstrap classes, 
 I made them only appear on large and extra large screens. Following recommendation on slack, and due to a disjointed UX, I changed the structure of the section from a table to a responsive
 bootstrap card so that the promotional information would appear on all screen sizes and maintain my mobile-first design. 

- Removed the fixed-bottom class on the footer as too much screen real estate was being lost in combination with a fixed header. 

- The images in the about us section and gallery are slow to load.
